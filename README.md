# Research Paper
This repository contains a suite of security-oriented serverless microbenchmarks developed as part of a project conducted at the Royal Holloway University of London [Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday). For further information, please refer to the paper [Towards Inter-service Data Flow Analysis of Serverless Applications](https://conf.researchr.org/details/saner-2024/saner-2024-early-research-achievement--era--track-/99/Towards-Inter-service-Data-Flow-Analysis-of-Serverless-Applications), which was presented at _The IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)_ in March 2024.

# Additional Documentation
The slides used to present the above-mentioned SANER 2024 paper are available in this repository [here](./docs/SANER24_Data_Flow_Analysis_Serverless_Presentation.pdf). It is also worth noting that one of the main inputs of this work is our previous [research paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3592533.3592811) on the AWSomePy dataset, which is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7838077).
