# Research Paper
This repository contains a suite of security-oriented serverless microbenchmarks developed as part of a project conducted at the Royal Holloway University of London [Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday). For further information, please refer to the paper [Towards Inter-service Data Flow Analysis of Serverless Applications](https://conf.researchr.org/details/saner-2024/saner-2024-early-research-achievement--era--track-/99/Towards-Inter-service-Data-Flow-Analysis-of-Serverless-Applications), which will be presented at _The IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)_ in March 2024.

# Additional Documentation
A high-level overview of our research work, which includes the development of the microbenchmarks stored in this repository and the analysis of the [AWSomePy dataset](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3592533.3592811), was presented at the [International Information Integrity Institute (i-4)](https://kpmg.com/uk/en/home/services/consulting/cyber-security/international-information-integrity-institute.html) roundtable event that took place in London in February 2024. The presentation, which is available [here](./docs/I4_Roundtable_Serverless_Computing.pdf), also explains the serverless computing fundamentals, illustrates the security challenges of this paradigm, and then provides examples of tools currently used to secure serverless applications.
