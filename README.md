# Research Paper
This repository contains a suite of security-oriented serverless microbenchmarks developed as part of a project conducted at the Royal Holloway University of London [Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday). For further information, please refer to the paper [Towards Inter-service Data Flow Analysis of Serverless Applications](https://conf.researchr.org/details/saner-2024/saner-2024-early-research-achievement--era--track-/99/Towards-Inter-service-Data-Flow-Analysis-of-Serverless-Applications), which was presented at _The IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)_ in March 2024.

# Additional Documentation
The slides used to present the above-mentioned SANER 2024 paper are available in this repository [here](./docs/SANER24_Data_Flow_Analysis_Serverless_Presentation.pdf). It is also worth noting that one of the main inputs of this work is our previous [research paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3592533.3592811) on the AWSomePy dataset, which is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7838077).

Furthermore, this repository contains:

* [Presentation](./docs/Static_Analysis_of_Serverless_Applications_Recent_Results.pdf) given at the Centre for Doctoral Training Showcase event in April 2024. It includes a summary of the above-mentioned AWSomePy and SANER 2024 papers.
* [Presentation](./docs/MISCS_Data_Flow_Analysis_Serverless_Presentation.pdf) given at the Mathematics, Information Security and Computer Science (MISCS) Doctoral Conference held at Royal Holloway University of London in April 2024. It is focused on the SANER 2024 paper, but it provides additional information compared to the original SANER 2024 presentation.
